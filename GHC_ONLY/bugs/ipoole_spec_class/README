07-04-94 ipoole   added pi method for Lognum



To make, type "make".

To run, type "SpecClass".   The program prints a table (take several minutes).

Some notes:

1) SpecClass.lhs seems to take ~10 times longer to compile than any
   of the other modules, even though it is not the biggest.  (Without
   optimisation it seems normal).

2) Execution appears to be ~ 4 times slower than interpreted gofer!
   This is almost certainly due to the functions toDouble and toLognum
   which in Haskell have to go via Rational.  What is clearly needed
   is a method of type Real a => a -> Double, which could then be
   defined efficiently for each Real type.   The default method
   could still go via Rational.   I don't understand how
   Haskell has survived for so long without such a method (which
   makes me fear I've missed something...).

3) When compiled *without* optimsation, the program now (7-04-94)
   segmentation faults.   

4) A very hacky "showFixed" is used, to force Reals < 0.0 to be displayed 
   as 0.XXXXX, rather than in scientific form.   There must be better 
   way to do this.

5) The source is not pretty.

6) To run with Gofer, you'll need our Haskellised Gofer prelude, which I
   can provide (it originated from Andy Gill).

7) Anyone interested in the statistics underlying the classifier model should
   request: Ian Poole, "A statistical model for classifying cervical 
   monolayers", RN94_003,  MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh.
