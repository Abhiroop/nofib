This directory contains very simple GdH test programs.
GdH, Glasgow distributed Haskell, is an extension of Haskell98 for executing
programs on a network of machines, each running an instance of the 
distributed runtime-system (RTS). The RTS ("sticky GUM") is an extension
of the parallel RTS (GUM) adding explicit task placement. GdH uses
a virtual shared heap and implicit communication. For more details see
  http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~dsg/gdh

At the moment GdH is still in an experimental stage.
The compiler should know about a way "md" for building the distributed
version of the RTS (no modifications in the compiler are necessary).

This whole subdir needs integration into the nofib build machinery.
At the moment they are standalone makefiles.
If you want to play with them:
- Do a make all in the GdH dir for building modified versions of some 
  libraries.
- Go into one of the other dirs, containing one file test programs, and 
  do a make (prbly have to add -i../GdH)
