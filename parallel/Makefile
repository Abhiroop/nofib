# Old benchmarks we need to either update or kill:
# 
# bom: bill of materials?
# par001: looks like a test, not a benchmark
# coins: needs updating
# parfact: parallel factorial
# soda, soda7: small word-search algorithm
# minimax: looks like it was written for GRIP, needs a lot of updating
# NESL: a collection of benchmarks based on NESL examples
