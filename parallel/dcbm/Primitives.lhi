Hand-generated interface file for the Primitives module.

eq determines whether two values are identical (the *same pointer*
as in Lisp).  It does no evaluation, and errs on the side of safety.

boolval determines whether a Boolean expression is True, False or not
yet evaluated, returning TRUE, FALSE or UNKNOWN, respectively.  Again,
it does not evaluate its argument.

\begin{code}
interface Primitives where
import Types(BOOL)
eq :: a -> a -> Bool
boolval :: Bool -> BOOL
\end{code}
